To start it is necessary 
1. To start Mongodb on port 27017
2. Using node.js run app.js
3. Using the browser go to the localhost:3000

The application allows you to create and edit a database containing:
1. A collection of books stored in the library
2. A collection of users registered in the library

The application allows you to search for books by name and author, make a note in the database about the time of issue and the id of the reader who took the books. And also remove these marks when you return the book.
